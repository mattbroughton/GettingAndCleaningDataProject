##Description of the Process Used to Clean the Data

The following steps were take in cleaning the data:

1. The file "features.txt" was read into a data frame. Only those measurements that were a mean or a standard deviation were kept. The names of the variables were made more descriptive.
2. The files "y_test.txt" and "y_train.txt" were read in. The activity numbers were changed to descriptive activity names.
3. The files containing the variable data ("X_test.txt" and "X_train.txt") and the subject data (subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt") were read into data frames.
4.Columns representing the subject and activity data for the traning and test sets were added to the variable data using the cbind function.
5. The variable data for the test and training sets where combined into a single data frame using the rbind function.
6. A data frame containing the mean for each variable for each subject and each activty was created using the melt and dcast functions on test data frame containing the test and training sets. This data frame was written to a tab delimited file ("tidyData.txt").
